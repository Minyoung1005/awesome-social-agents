# Taxonomy
## 1 Environment
#### TBD
*The objectives of different agents*
### Social interaction types 

#### Collaboration
*The objectives are shared among agents*

#### Pure Competition
*The objectives are zero-sum*

#### Mixed Objectives
*Agentsâ€™ have different goals, but they are not zero-sum*

#### Implicit Objectives
*Goals are not expressed explicitly*

### Domains

#### Text and Speech

#### Embodied AI

#### Virtual Environments
