<!-- The integration of AI systems into our daily lives has become increasingly ubiquitous, with these systems now capable of interacting with humans in more human-like behaviors than ever before. Specifically, t -->
The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)/foundational models presents new opportunities for simulating complex human **social behaviors**. As a result, there is a rapidly growing body of work emerging in this domain. We hope to categorize and synergize recent efforts to provide a comprehensive guidebook of **social agents** weaving together multiple domains, including language, embodiment, and robotics. 

Ultimately, our goal is to illuminate the dawn of a new era characterized by socially intelligent automated agents, offering insights crucial for understanding and harnessing their potential impact on society. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. **We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.**
