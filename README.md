<!-- The integration of AI systems into our daily lives has become increasingly ubiquitous, with these systems now capable of interacting with humans in more human-like behaviors than ever before. Specifically, t -->
<!-- üéØ What is a **social agent**: A social agent is a human communicative agent that perceive environment, either social or physical, and act upon it with language, action, or non-verbal communication. -->
<details>
  <summary><i>Examples:</i></summary>
    | Examples*    | Social agent | Socially intelligent agent |
    | -------- | ------- |  ------- |
    | Agent outputing only yes or no | ‚úî, if the yes or no is somewhat meaningful  | ‚úî, if the yes or no is interpretable by a certain group of people. But the communication bandwidth is quite limited, so its social intelligence level could be low. |
    | Agent outputting only yes | ‚ùå, the agent could not perceive environment and act accordingly    | ‚ùå |
    | [StarCraft](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z) Agents    |  ‚úî, they interact  |‚ùå, humans cannot understand their internal signals |
    | Agents speak an artificial code language that only few people understand | ‚úî, they interact | ‚úî, they interact and communicate in a human-interpretable way |
    | [Trisolarans](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Trisolaran) | ‚úî, they interact | ‚ùå, their way of interaction is different from how humans communicate. They are essentially mind readers, and they don't need theory of mind |
    | A newspaper, or a bot that only responds you with today's weather in Pittsburgh | ‚ùå, they don't interact | ‚ùå |
    | A [Webareana](https://webarena.dev/) agent | ‚ùå, they only interact the browser environment | ‚ùå |
    | A tree | ‚ùå, they don't interact | ‚ùå |
    | A lightbulb with motion sensor that turns on when you walk by | ? | ? |
    | Self-driving cars on the real road | ‚úî, they interact |?|

    *All the examples here are assuming humans are part of the environment.

> [!Note]
> * **Agent** and **Environment** (Sutton and Barto 2018): An agent is a goal-driven decision-maker that sense and act upon the state of the environment. An environment comprises the state outside the agent, including the other agents if any. 
> * **Social Agent**: An agent that interacts with a multi-agent environment.
> * **Socially Intelligent Agent**: A social agent that interacts and communicates with other agents in a human-interpretable way.

> <li>The social intelligence that we are focusing on is human-like, excluding the collective intelligence in a lot of social animals like ants, bees, fishes. </li> 
> <li>To understand whether an entity is a (social) agent, we have to situate it in an environment. It is not possible to discuss an agent outside of an environment. </li>

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)/foundational models presents new opportunities for simulating complex human **social behaviors**. As a result, there is a rapidly growing body of work emerging in this domain. We hope to categorize and synergize recent efforts to provide a comprehensive guidebook of **social agents** weaving together multiple domains, including language, embodiment, and robotics. 

Our goal is to offer insights crucial for understanding and harnessing **social agents'** potential impact on society. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. **We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.**

üìù *We are currently working on a survey paper related to content of this repository. Stay tuned for updates!*
